SE @ Modulus a Progress Company
I started in Java, technically I started with Logo

After learning JS for front-end work I got into Node

I started at Modulus &amp; have been spoiled by the deployment process

---

1. API using hapi.js
2. Website using React &amp; Webpack
3. Set up MongoDB
4. Deploy Project
5. Scale, Look into Logs, etc. via CLI
6. Metrics, Auto Scaling and more via UI

???
Today we'll start by making a quick api using hapi.js to show how to deploy a
Node app.  Then we'll deploy the UI using react to show how to deploy a static
site, specifically react/webpack.  After that we'll delve into the many
benefits what else we get when deploying with modulus via the cli &amp; the UI.

---

API:
  First we'll create a simple API uisng hapi.js

Website:
  I'm going to use a webpack file but not go into too much detail bc we have limited time.
  Now we'll just make a home page that pulls in all of our objects.
  In order to make this work with Modulus's nginx config we'll add this file.

Sign up &amp; Create Projects:
  We have all of our website &amp; API so we'll go ahead and sign up for Modulus via the cli
  'npm i modulus -g'
  'modulus sign up'
  'modulus create project' // for the api
  and again for the website

  with these projects created we can deploy their respective files
  go to api project directory and 'modulus project deploy'
  then we can take the address of the api and update our website
  once that is done we can go to the website directory and 'modulus project deploy'

  then use 'modulus mongo create' // to make a db for the api
  we use the provided mongo url to update our api code
  then we just need to redploy the api code with the new changes

Modulus CLI:
  Now that the project is complete let's mess with it
  First we'll scale our website up to 3 servos, just in case it gets popular
  'modulus project scale 3'

  We can also start, stop or just restart our project using
  'modulus project start/stop/restart'

  If we want to look at the servos that our project is running on
  'modulus servo list'
  Then we can either restart all of them with 'modulus servo restart'
  Or restart a particular one with the flag '-i <SERVO-ID>

  To see any output from the projects we can tail the logs
  'modulus project logs tail'

Modulus UI:
  To look at more metrics &amp; set up auto-scaling we can move to the UI.
  Metrics Tab, Do we need all of these servos?
  Auto scaling change the servo based on memory, requests or cpu usageo
  Need to look more in-depth into your logs you can download them here
  Add webhooks to recieve project updates
  Change anything even runtime on your administration page.
